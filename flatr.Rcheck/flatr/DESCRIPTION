Title: Transforms Contingency Tables to Data Frames, and Analyses Them
Version: 0.01.0
Author: Scott D. Graham
Maintainer: Scott D. Graham <scott.grah95@gmail.com>
Description: Contingency Tables are a pain to work with when you want to run regressions.
  This package takes them, flattens them into a long data frame, so you can more easily analyse them!
  As well, you can calculate other related statistics. All of this is done so in a 'tidy' manner,
  so it should tie in nicely with 'tidyverse' series of packages.
