# flatr
## Overview
`flatr` is a package designed to make the analysis of contingency tables easier. 

Contingency tables are a popular means of presenting categorical data in textbooks, as they take up very little space, while still allowing to present all the data. However, this means makes it tough to run analysis on them. `flatr` helps ease this pain by turning $i \times j \times k$ contingency tables into "tidy" data.
